description: Snyk Code is a developer-first static application security testing (SAST) solution. By scanning code in real-time and providing actionable insights directly in the developer workflow across IDEs, repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, you can identify and address vulnerabilities early on. The AI-based engine results in fewer false positives for your developers, improving code quality and security.

    !!! warning "Key Considerations"

        - **Data retention policy** ([Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-data-and-governance/how-snyk-handles-your-data#snyk-code)):

            - Snyk stores project metadata and analysis results (e.g., filenames and vulnerability locations).
            - Snyk does not store your source code.
        
        - **Limited usage**:

            - The free plan is limited to **100** Snyk Code tests per month.

    !!! config "Snyk Auth Token"

        Authentication via `snyk auth` (OAuth) creates a temporary session that will expire, requiring periodic re-authentication. 
        
        For persistent access, this integration requires a long-lived Auth Token:

        - Navigate to your [Account settings > General > Auth Token](https://app.snyk.io/account) to obtain your token.

        - Store the token in the tool's configuration directory:

            ```bash
            mkdir -p  ~/.codesectools/config/SnykCode
            echo <your-auth-token-here> > ~/.codesectools/config/SnykCode/auth_token.txt
            ```
