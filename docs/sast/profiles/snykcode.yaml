description: Snyk Code is a developer-first static application security testing (SAST) solution. By scanning code in real-time and providing actionable insights directly in the developer workflow across IDEs, repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, you can identify and address vulnerabilities early on. The AI-based engine results in fewer false positives for your developers, improving code quality and security.

    !!! warning "Key Considerations"

        - **Data retention policy** ([How Snyk handles your data - docs.snyk.io](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-data-and-governance/how-snyk-handles-your-data#snyk-code)):

            - Snyk stores *project metadata* and *analysis results* (filenames, the position of vulnerabilities in the code);
            - Snyk does not store the *source code*.
        
        - **Limited usage**:

            - Free plan allows for **100** Snyk Code tests/month.

    !!! config "Snyk Auth Token"

        Authentication via `snyk auth` (OAuth) is temporary and will expire, requiring you to re-authenticate periodically. 
        
        To ensure persistent access, the tool requires a long-lived Auth Token:

        - Go to your [Account settings > General > Auth Token](https://app.snyk.io/account);

        - Store the token in the tool config:

            ```bash
            mkdir -p  ~/.codesectools/config/SnykCode
            echo <your-auth-token-here> > ~/.codesectools/config/SnykCode/auth_token.txt
            ```
